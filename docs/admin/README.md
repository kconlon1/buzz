# Read-only deployment moderation dashboard

Buzz can expose a private, deployment-wide read-only dashboard from the existing
relay process. It shows open moderation reports and recent product feedback.

Configure `BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` to activate the dashboard. A private ingress limits
access to the operator VPN or approved source IPs.

Required configuration:

```text
BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST=admin.example.com
BUZZ_ADMIN_WEB_DIR=/srv/buzz/admin-web
```

Plus one of the authentication modes below.

## Authentication

The admin API requires explicit authentication configuration. Setting only
`BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` is a startup error — there is no insecure default.

### Token mode (recommended for public-facing or OSS deployments)

Every `/api/admin/v1` request must carry the operator token as a bearer
credential.

```text
BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN=<64 hex characters>
```

The relay fails closed if `BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN` is missing or invalid when
`BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` is set:

- `BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN` must be exactly 64 hexadecimal characters (32 bytes).
  Surrounding whitespace is trimmed; anything else — empty, non-hex, wrong
  length, non-Unicode — is a startup error.
- `BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN` set without `BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` is ignored: the admin surface
  stays absent and the relay logs a warning at startup.

Generate a token once per deployment and store it with your other secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Call the API with it:

```bash
curl -H "Host: admin.example.com" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     https://admin.example.com/api/admin/v1/reports
```

A missing, malformed, duplicated, or incorrect credential returns `401` with
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` and reveals nothing about the expected `Host`. The
scheme is matched case-insensitively per RFC 9110, and the credential is
compared in constant time. The token never appears in URLs, logs, or traces.

The dashboard probes for auth mode on first load: if the relay returns `401` to
an unauthenticated request, the dashboard prompts for the token and keeps it in
`sessionStorage` for that browser session; a rejected token is discarded and
re-prompted. Attachment bytes are fetched through the authenticated API and
rendered from object URLs, because `<img src>` and `<a href>` cannot carry an
`Authorization` header.

In token mode, each new browser session issues one unauthenticated probe that
returns `401` by design before the token is entered. If you alert on admin-API
`401`s, exclude these single-probe sequences (one `401` immediately followed by
authenticated requests from the same session) to avoid false positives.

The shared token authenticates the deployment operator role, not a person. It
carries no per-operator identity, attribution, or individual revocation —
rotating it revokes access for everyone at once.

### Network-layer auth mode (for deployments behind a VPN or private ingress)

Operators whose admin API is already protected at the network layer — for
example by a corporate VPN such as WARP+Okta — can disable bearer authentication
entirely:

```text
BUZZ_ADMIN_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true
```

Only the exact value `true` is accepted; any other non-empty value is a startup
error. `BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN` and `BUZZ_ADMIN_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true` set at the same
time is also a startup error (ambiguous intent).

In this mode the relay logs a `WARN` on every startup:

```
BUZZ_ADMIN_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true — the admin API is unauthenticated; the
operator has asserted that access is controlled at the network layer
```

The `Host`/`Origin` checks remain active as defense-in-depth. The dashboard
detects that no token is needed on first load (probe returns `200`) and skips
the token prompt, rendering the dashboard directly.

**This mode relies entirely on the operator's network controls.** If the admin
API is reachable by untrusted clients, the entire moderation and feedback dataset
is exposed. Use token mode instead.

When using a reverse proxy in this mode, document the requirement and consider a
proxy-injected shared secret or signed identity header for additional assurance.

## Content Security Policy

Every admin-host response that carries the dashboard itself — the SPA document
on each admin route, the hashed `/assets/*` bundle, and admin-host `404`s — is
served with a Content Security Policy response header, `ADMIN_CSP` in
`crates/buzz-relay/src/router.rs`:

```text
default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self' blob:; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'
```

It blocks inline and third-party script and restricts subresource and request
destinations to the same origin, which closes the direct paths an injected
script would use to exfiltrate credentials or data. It does not constrain
top-level navigation, so it is a containment layer, not a substitute for
keeping script off the origin. `blob:` is permitted for images only, for
attachment previews. It is a response header rather than a `<meta>` tag because
`frame-ancestors` is ignored in meta — that directive is the dashboard's
authoritative frame protection, superseding the `X-Frame-Options: DENY` the JSON
API sends. The policy applies to the admin host only; the public web bundle
keeps its own headers.

The exact admin `Host` and matching browser `Origin` are still required in both
auth modes, but they are defense-in-depth, not the primary access control. HTTPS
and a private ingress remain required: in token mode the token is a bearer
credential in transit; in network-layer mode the VPN/firewall boundary is the
only access control.

When the UI runs in a separate pod, proxy `/api/admin/v1/*` to the relay while
preserving the admin `Host` header and (in token mode) the client's
`Authorization` header. A `NetworkPolicy` grants the admin pod access to that
relay path.

## Operator migration

**Upgrading from a pre-auth release (Buzz prior to the introduction of this
`BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` requirement):** any deployed relay with `BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` set
refuses to start after upgrade unless one of the two auth variables is also set.
Choose the mode that fits your deployment:

- **Token mode:** mint a token with `openssl rand -hex 32`, set `BUZZ_ADMIN_TOKEN`
  in your deploy config, then roll the new version.
- **Network-layer mode (e.g. Block's `bb-public` behind WARP+Okta):** set
  `BUZZ_ADMIN_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true` in your deploy config (a static non-secret),
  then roll the new version.

Relays without `BUZZ_ADMIN_HOST` are completely unaffected.

Any non-browser client of `/api/admin/v1` using the token mode (monitoring
probes, scripts, cron jobs) must add `Authorization: Bearer` to their requests
after the upgrade. The dashboard handles itself. If a reverse proxy strips or
rewrites `Authorization` headers, the dashboard breaks post-upgrade even with the
token set — check proxy configuration before rolling.

## Local development

For local review, run `just admin-seed` before `just admin`. `just admin` mints a
throwaway token for that run and prints it — paste it into the dashboard prompt.
The seed command also uploads real image and diagnostic fixtures to local MinIO.
Feedback search and filters run over the bounded browser result set; the
**Acted on** checkbox is stored in that browser's local storage.

## Read routes

- `GET /api/admin/v1/reports`
- `GET /api/admin/v1/reports/:id`
- `GET /api/admin/v1/feedback`
- `GET /api/admin/v1/feedback/:id`

Report reads accept optional `communityId`, `status`, `reportType`, `targetKind`,
`after`, `before`, and `limit` parameters. Limits are capped at 200. Feedback is
a bounded newest-first summary from the existing product-feedback repository.

## Feedback attachment boundary

Feedback attachment bytes are available only through the feedback-scoped read
route:

- `GET /api/admin/v1/feedback/:id/attachments/:sha256`

The route uses the same bearer credential (or network-layer boundary in
insecure_no_auth mode), private-ingress, exact admin `Host`, and same-origin
boundary as the JSON API. It is not a generic media endpoint. The relay loads
the feedback row, derives its community from server-owned provenance, verifies
that host resolution still maps to the row's `community_id`, and requires the
requested SHA-256 to match both the `x` field and source-community `/media/` URL
in that row's persisted `imeta` tag. It then reads the tenant-scoped media
sidecar before accessing the shared content-addressed blob. Unknown feedback,
unreferenced hashes, malformed paths, and cross-community substitutions all
collapse to `404`.

Only `GET` and `HEAD` are routed. Existing community `/media/*` authorization is
unchanged, including `BUZZ_REQUIRE_MEDIA_GET_AUTH`; the browser receives no
Blossom credential or reusable signed URL. Responses are uncached, `nosniff`,
governed by a restrictive CSP, streamed from object storage, and non-previewable
content retains attachment disposition. Successful reads produce a structured
trace containing feedback ID, community ID, and attachment hash, but no feedback
body or attachment URL.

The human trust boundary is the chosen auth mode plus the private admin ingress.
Neither token mode nor network-layer mode provides per-operator identity. Anyone
admitted to the dashboard can read attachments for feedback records they can
access. Per-person attribution or revocation requires authenticated operator
identity at ingress/application level (for example an Okta-injected identity
header or a NIP-98 pubkey allowlist); this endpoint deliberately does not claim
to provide it.
